- {{COMPONENT_STRUCTURE_RULE}}
- Follow the {{COMPONENT_PATTERN}} pattern for all components.
- Use clear and descriptive naming for props, events, and methods.
- Keep logic within components focused and manageable.
- Add code comments for complex logic or non-obvious implementations.
- Use bracketed identifiers for logs: `[ComponentName]: message`.
